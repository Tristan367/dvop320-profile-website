This repository is a portfolio website assigment from dvop320 at Spokane Community College.

I already had git installed so I just used these commands in the website's directory of my local machine:

git init
git config --global user.name "Tristan367"
git config --global user.email "t_johnson367@outlook.com"
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of website files"

I then created the repo from Github and entered these commands:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Tristan367/dvop320-profile-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

After confirming the push was successful I went to Settings > Pages and hosted the site with the Github Pages feature

Finally, I created this readme
